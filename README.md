# Hey hey 👋 I'm Liza!!

I'm an aspiring fullstack developer living abroad in Tallin, Estonia 🇪🇪

I'm currently developing a Web3 e-commerce application within a server-less architecture using Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, and Wagmi. 

### Bio:
- 👀 I'm currently learning React and Redux
- 🌱 I’m want to learn more about Web3, crypto, and continue to contribute to open source projects
- 🧶 Fun fact: I love to crochet and I'm obsessed with building Legos!
