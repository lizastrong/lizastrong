# Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Liza!!

I'm an aspiring fullstack developer living abroad!

I'm currently developing a Web3 e-commerce application within a server-less architecture using Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, and Wagmi. 

### Bio:
- ðŸ‘€ I'm currently learning Node.js and everything back-end related!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m want to learn more about Web3, crypto, and continue to contribute to open source projects
- ðŸ§¶ Fun fact: I love to crochet and I'm obsessed with building Legos!
